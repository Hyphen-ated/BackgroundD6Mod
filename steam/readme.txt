This mod gives you a built-in D6 ability, in addition to your active item slot.

To use it, you also have to run an Input Server utility, located here: https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/BackgroundD6Mod/releases

You bind a key inside this external utility, and press that key to use your D6 ability.

You have to turn on the --luadebug option in order for the input server to talk to isaac:
steam -> right click isaac -> properties -> general -> set launch options -> type in --luadebug
