    <description>This mod gives you a built-in D6 ability, in addition to your active item slot.
        The default key to activate this ability is 'T'. If you want to change it,
        use the custom challenge called "Change Keybind For Built-In D6."

        The built-in D6 charges when you clear rooms, can't be dropped, and can't be charged by battery pickups.
