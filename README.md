# BackgroundD6Mod
This is a Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ Mod for giving you a built-in D6 ability.
It gets one tick of charge every time you clear a room. You can't use batteries to charge it.

In order to use this mod you must add the '--luadebug' launch option to Isaac.
steam -> right click isaac -> properties -> general -> set launch options -> --luadebug

You must also run an external program called the Background D6 Input Server.
It can be downloaded from https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/BackgroundD6Mod/releases

This program is what allows us to make a custom keybind. When you launch the program,
there will be a button you click to select the key you want to use to trigger the D6 ability.

If you play with a controller, use a program like joytokey to map the controller button
you'd like to use onto a keyboard key.
